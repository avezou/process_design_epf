    Establish expectations
</h3>
<p>
    Those who find developer testing rewarding do it. Those who view it as a chore find ways to avoid it. This is simply in
    the nature of most developers in most industries, and treating it as a shameful lack of discipline hasn't historically
    been successful. Therefore, as a developer you should expect testing to be rewarding and do what it takes to make it
    rewarding.
</p>
<p>
    Ideal developer testing follows a very tight edit-test loop. You make a small change to the product, such as adding a
    new method to a class, then you immediately rerun your tests. If any test breaks, you know exactly what code is the
    cause. This easy, steady pace of development is the greatest reward of developer testing. A long debugging session
    should be exceptional.
</p>
<p>
    Because it's not unusual for a change made in one class to break something in another, you should expect to rerun not
    just the changed class's tests, but many tests. Ideally, you rerun the complete test suite for your implementation
    element many times per hour. Every time you make a significant change, you rerun the suite, watch the results, and
    either proceed to the next change or fix the last change. Expect to spend some effort making that rapid feedback
    possible.
</p>
<h3>
    Write and maintain&nbsp;tests
</h3>
<h4>
    Automate your tests
</h4>
<p>
    Running tests often is not practical if tests are manual. For some implementation elements, automated tests are easy.
    An example would be an in-memory database. It communicates to its clients through an API and has no other interface to
    the outside world. Tests for it would look something like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
/* Check that elements can be added at most once. */
// Setup
Database db = new Database();
db.add("key1", "value1");
// Test
boolean result = db.add("key1", "another value");
expect(result == false);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The tests are different from ordinary client code in only one way: instead of believing the results of API calls, they
    check. If the API makes client code easy to write, it makes test code easy to write. If the test code is <i>not</i>
    easy to write, you've received an early warning that the API could be improved. Test-first design is thus consistent
    with the iterative processes' focus on addressing important risks early.
</p>
<p>
    The more tightly connected the element is to the outside world, however, the harder it will be to test. There are two
    common cases: graphical user interfaces and back-end components.
</p>
<h5>
    Graphical user interfaces
</h5>
<p>
    Suppose the database in the example above receives its data via a callback from a user-interface object. The callback
    is invoked when the user fills in some text fields and pushes a button. Testing this by manually filling in the fields
    and pushing the button isn't something you want to do many times an hour. You must arrange a way to deliver the input
    under programmatic control, typically by "pushing" the button in code.
</p>
<p>
    Pushing the button causes some code in the implementation element to be executed. Most likely, that code changes the
    state of some user-interface objects. So you must also arrange a way to query those objects programmatically.
</p>
<h5>
    Back-end components
</h5>
<p>
    Suppose the element under test doesn't implement a database. Instead, it's a wrapper around a real, on-disk database.
    Testing against that real database might be difficult. It might be hard to install and configure. Licenses for it might
    be expensive. The database might slow down the tests enough that you're not inclined to run them often. In such cases,
    it's worthwhile to "stub out" the database with a simpler element that does just enough to support the tests.
</p>
<p>
    Stubs are also useful when a component that your element talks to isn't ready yet. You don't want your testing to wait
    on someone else's code.
</p>
<h4>
    Don't write your own tools
</h4>
<p>
    Developer testing seems pretty straightforward. You set up some objects, make a call through an API, check the result,
    and announce a test failure if the results aren't as expected. It's also convenient to have some way to group tests so
    that they can be run individually or as complete suites. Tools that support those requirements are called <i>test
    frameworks</i>.
</p>
<p>
    Developer testing <b>is</b> straightforward, and the requirements for test frameworks are not complicated. If, however,
    you yield to the temptation of writing your own test framework, you'll spend much more time tinkering with the
    framework than you probably expect. There are many test frameworks available, both commercial and open source, and
    there's no reason not to use one of those.
</p>
<h4>
    Do create support code
</h4>
<p>
    Test code tends to be repetitive. It's common to see sequences of code like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// null name not allowed
retval = o.createName(""); 
expect(retval == null);
// leading spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName(" l"); 
expect(retval == null);
// trailing spaces not allowed
retval = o.createName("name "); 
expect(retval == null);
// first character may not be numeric
retval = o.createName("5allpha"); 
expect(retval == null);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    This code is created by copying one check, pasting it, then editing it to make another check.
</p>
<p>
    The danger here is twofold. If the interface changes, much editing will have to be done. (In more complicated cases, a
    simple global replacement won't suffice.) Also, if the code is at all complicated, the intent of the test can be lost
    amid all the text.
</p>
<p>
    When you find yourself repeating yourself, seriously consider factoring out the repetition into support code. Even
    though the code above is a simple example, it's more readable and maintainable if written like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
void expectNameRejected(MyClass o, String s) {
Object retval = o.createName(s);
expect(retval == null);
}
...
// null name not allowed
expectNameRejected(o, ""); 
// leading spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, " l"); 
// trailing spaces not allowed.
expectNameRejected(o, "name "); 
// first character may not be numeric.
expectNameRejected(o, "5alpha"); 
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Developers writing tests often err on the side of too much copying-and-pasting. If you suspect yourself of that
    tendency, it's useful to consciously err in the other direction. Resolve that you will strip your code of all duplicate
    text.
</p>
<h4>
    Keep the tests understandable
</h4>
<p>
    You should expect that you, or someone else, will have to modify the tests later. A typical situation is that a later
    iteration calls for a change to the element's behavior. As a simple example, suppose the element once declared a square
    root method like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <font size="+0">double sqrt(double x);</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In that version, a negative argument caused the function "sqrt" to return NaN ("not a number" from the IEEE 754-1985
    <i>Standard for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic</i>). In the new iteration, the square root method will accept
    negative numbers and return a complex result:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
        <font size="+0">Complex sqrt(double x);</font>
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Old tests for the function "sqrt" will have to change. That means understanding what they do, and updating them so that
    they work with the new "sqrt". When updating tests, you must take care not to destroy their bug-finding power. One way
    that sometimes happens is this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
void testSQRT () {
//  Update these tests for Complex 
// when I have time -- bem
/*
double result = sqrt(0.0);
...
*/
}
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    Other ways are more subtle: the tests are changed so that they actually run, but they no longer test what they were
    originally intended to test. The end result, over many iterations, can be a test suite that is too weak to catch many
    bugs. This is sometimes called "test suite decay". A decayed suite will be abandoned, because it's not worth the
    upkeep.
</p>
<p>
    Test suite decay is less likely in the direct tests for the function "sqrt" than in indirect tests. There will be code
    that calls the function "sqrt". That code will have tests. When the function "sqrt" changes, some of those tests will
    fail. The person who changes the function "sqrt" will probably have to change those tests. Because he's less familiar
    with them, and because their relationship to the change is less clear, he's more likely to weaken them in the process
    of making them pass.
</p>
<p>
    When you're creating support code for tests (as urged above), be careful: the support code should clarify, not obscure,
    the purpose of the tests that use it. A common complaint about object-oriented programs is that there's no one place
    where anything's done. If you look at any one method, all you discover is that it forwards its work somewhere else.
    Such a structure has advantages, but it makes it harder for new people to understand the code. Unless they make an
    effort, their changes are likely to be incorrect or to make the code even more complicated and fragile. The same is
    true of test code, except that later maintainers are even less likely to take due care. You must head off the problem
    by writing understandable tests.
</p>
<h4>
    Match the test structure to the product structure
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose someone has inherited your implementation element. They need to change a part of it. They may want to examine
    the old tests to help them in their new design. They want to update the old tests before writing the code (test-first
    design).
</p>
<p>
    All those good intentions will go by the wayside if they can't find the appropriate tests. What they'll do is make the
    change, see what tests fail, then fix those. That will contribute to test suite decay.
</p>
<p>
    For that reason, it's important that the test suite be well structured, and that the location of tests be predictable
    from the structure of the product. Most usually, developers arrange tests in a parallel hierarchy, with one test class
    per product class. So if someone is changing a class named "Log", they know the test class is "TestLog", and they know
    where the source file can be found.
</p>
<h4>
    Let tests violate encapsulation
</h4>
<p>
    You might limit your tests to interacting with your implementation element exactly as client code does, through the
    same interface that client code uses. However, this has disadvantages. Suppose you're testing a simple class that
    maintains a doubly linked list:
</p>
<p>
    In particular, you're testing the "DoublyLinkedList.insertBefore(Object existing, Object newObject)" method. In one of
    your tests, you want to insert an element in the middle of the list, then check if it's been inserted successfully. The
    test uses the list above to create this updated list:
</p>
<p>
    It checks the list correctness like this:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// the list is now one longer. 
expect(list.size()==3);
// the new element is in the correct position
expect(list.get(1)==m);
// check that other elements are still there.
expect(list.get(0)==a);
expect(list.get(2)==z);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    That seems sufficient, but it's not. Suppose the list implementation is incorrect and backward pointers are not set
    correctly. That is, suppose the updated list actually looks like this:
</p>
<p>
    If the function "DoublyLinkedList.get(int index)" traverses the list from the beginning to the end (likely), the test
    would miss this failure. If the class provides "elementBefore" and "elementAfter" methods, checking for such failures
    is straightforward:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// Check that links were all updated
expect(list.elementAfter(a)==m);
expect(list.elementAfter(m)==z);
expect(list.elementBefore(z)==m); //this will fail
expect(list.elementBefore(m)==a);
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    But what if it doesn't provide those methods? You could devise more elaborate sequences of method calls that will fail
    if the suspected defect is present. For example, this would work:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
// Check whether back-link from Z is correct.
list.insertBefore(z, x);
// If it was incorrectly not updated, X will have 
// been inserted just after A.
expect(list.get(1)==m); 
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    But such a test is more work to create and is likely to be significantly harder to maintain. (Unless you write good
    comments, it will not be at all clear why the test is doing what it's doing.) There are two solutions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        Add the "elementBefore" and "elementAfter" methods to the public interface. But that effectively exposes the
        implementation to everyone and makes future change more difficult.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let the tests "look under the hood" and check pointers directly.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    The latter is usually the best solution, even for a simple class like "DoublyLinkedList" and especially for the more
    complex classes that occur in your products.
</p>
<p>
    Typically, tests are put in the same package as the class they test. They are given protected or friend access.
</p>
<h4>
    Approaches for Test Setup
</h4>
<p>
    To successfully run a test, the system must be in a known state. To do this you will need objects or components in
    memory, rows in the database, etc. that you will test against. The easiest approach is to hardcode the required data
    and the setup code within the test itself. The primary advantage is that all the information that you need about the
    test is in one place and that the test is potentially self-sufficient.
</p>
<p>
    Another approach is to define an external data set which is loaded into memory or into the database at the beginning of
    the test run. There are several advantages to this approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It decouples the test data from the test.
    </li>
    <li>
        More than one test can use the same data set.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is easy to modify and/or multiply the test data.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    There are some disadvantages to this approach:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Increased complexity for maintaining the external data
    </li>
    <li>
        Potential coupling between test cases. When they share a common test data bed it becomes very easy to write tests
        that depend on other tests running first, thereby coupling them together.
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>
    Coding for Testability
</h4>
<p>
    Add&nbsp;<a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.tech.common.base/guidances/termdefinitions/code_instrumentation_3060875F.html" guid="_lzAWkK9eEdyltJ0KgEd9WQ">code instrumentation</a> for testing and debugging. Pay special attention to the
    implementation of the observation/control points, such as critical functions or objects, as these aspects might need
    special support that has to be implemented in the application under test.
</p>
<h4>
    Reviewing Tests
</h4>
<p>
    If a test will be long-lived, ask a person with less inside knowledge of the implementation element to run it and check
    if there is enough support information. Review it with other people within the development team and other interested
    parties as needed.
</p>
<h3>
    <a id="TestDesignMistakes" name="TestDesignMistakes"></a>Characteristic Test Design Mistakes
</h3>
<p>
    Each test exercises an implementation element and checks for correct results. The design of the test-the inputs it uses
    and how it checks for correctness-can be good at revealing defects, or it can inadvertently hide them. Here are some
    characteristic test design mistakes.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to specify expected results in advance
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose you're testing an implementation element that converts XML into HTML. A temptation is to take some sample XML,
    run it through the conversion, then look at the results in a browser. If the screen looks right, you "bless" the HTML
    by saving it as the official expected results. Thereafter, a test compares the actual output of the conversion to the
    expected results.
</p>
<p>
    This is a dangerous practice. Even sophisticated computer users are used to believing what the computer does. You are
    likely to overlook mistakes in the screen appearance. (Not to mention that browsers are quite tolerant of misformatted
    HTML.) By making that incorrect HTML the official expected results, you make sure that the test can never find the
    problem.
</p>
<p>
    It's less dangerous to doubly-check by looking directly at the HTML, but it's still dangerous. Because the output is
    complicated, it will be easy to overlook errors. You'll find more defects if you write the expected output by hand
    first.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to check the background
</h4>
<p>
    Tests usually check that what should have been changed has been, but their creators often forget to check that what
    should have been left alone has been left alone. For example, suppose a program is supposed to change the first 100
    records in a file. It's a good idea to check that the 101<sup>st</sup> hasn't been changed.
</p>
<p>
    In theory, you would check that nothing in the "background"-the entire file system, all of memory, everything reachable
    through the network-has been left alone. In practice, you have to choose carefully what you can afford to check. But
    it's important to make that choice.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to check persistence
</h4>
<p>
    Just because the implementation element tells you a change has been made, that doesn't mean it has actually been
    committed to the database. You need to check the database via another route.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to add variety
</h4>
<p>
    A test might be designed to check the effect of three fields in a database record, but many other fields need to be
    filled in to execute the test. Testers will often use the same values over and over again for these "irrelevant"
    fields. For example, they'll always use the name of their lover in a text field, or 999 in a numeric field.
</p>
<p>
    The problem is that sometimes what shouldn't matter actually does. Every so often, there's a bug that depends on some
    obscure combination of unlikely inputs. If you always use the same inputs, you stand no chance of finding such bugs. If
    you persistently vary inputs, you might. Quite often, it costs almost nothing to use a number different than 999 or to
    use someone else's name. When varying the values used in tests costs almost nothing and it has some potential benefit,
    then vary. (Note: It's unwise to use names of old lovers instead of your current one if your current lover works with
    you.)
</p>
<p>
    Here's another benefit. One plausible fault is for the program to use field <i>X</i> when it should have used field
    <i>Y</i>. If both fields contain "Dawn", the fault can't be detected.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to use realistic data
</h4>
<p>
    It's common to use made-up data in tests. That data is often unrealistically simple. For example, customer names might
    be "Mickey", "Snoopy", and "Donald". Because that data is different from what real users enter - for example, it's
    characteristically shorter - it can miss defects real customers will see. For example, these one-word names wouldn't
    detect that the code doesn't handle names with spaces.
</p>
<p>
    It's prudent to make a slight extra effort to use realistic data.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to notice that the code does nothing at all
</h4>
<p>
    Suppose you initialize a database record to zero, run a calculation that should result in zero being stored in the
    record, then check that the record is zero. What has your test demonstrated? The calculation might not have taken place
    at all. Nothing might have been stored, and the test couldn't tell.
</p>
<p>
    That example sounds unlikely. But this same mistake can crop up in subtler ways. For example, you might write a test
    for a complicated installer program. The test is intended to check that all temporary files are removed after a
    successful installation. But, because of all the installer options, in that test, one particular temporary file wasn't
    created. Sure enough, that's the one the program forgot to remove.
</p>
<h4>
    Failure to notice that the code does the wrong thing
</h4>
<p>
    Sometimes a program does the right thing for the wrong reasons. As a trivial example, consider this code:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<!-- START NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
if (a &lt; b && c) 
return 2 * x;
else
return x * x;
<!-- END NON-TRANSLATABLE -->
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
    The logical expression is wrong, and you've written a test that causes it to evaluate incorrectly and take the wrong
    branch. Unfortunately, purely by coincidence, the variable X has the value 2 in that test. So the result of the wrong
    branch is accidentally correct - the same as the result the right branch would have given.
</p>
<p>
    For each expected result, you should ask if there's a plausible way in which that result could be&nbsp;achieved for the
    wrong reason. While it's often impossible to know, sometimes it's not.
</p><p/><h3>
    Write the tests first
</h3>
<p>
    Writing the tests after the code is a chore. The urge is to rush through it, to finish up and move on. Writing tests
    before the code makes testing part of a positive feedback loop. As you implement more code, you see more tests passing
    until finally all the tests pass and you're done. People who write tests first seem to be more successful, and it takes
    no more time. For more on putting tests first, see <a class="elementLinkWithType" href="./../../../practice.tech.test_driven_development.base/guidances/guidelines/test_driven_development_F581182D.html" guid="_5s_DUJ03EdyQ3oTO93enUw">Guideline: Test Driven Development</a>.
