  <mainDescription>Project initialization starts with the statement of requirement description includes the main function of the software with&#xD;
one or two sentences made by the person or people who requested the software. This explanation could be illustrated as&#xD;
below:&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
“It is necessary a graphical user interface for the user management in the system.”&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
A Project leader is determined after the person who requested the software convey this information to the Operational&#xD;
Coordinator.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
After the Project Leader is determined, a representational code name is determined for the project and with this name a&#xD;
project is opened under Pardus Project T racking System (tracker.pardus.org.tr). It could be expressed as a sub-project of&#xD;
another project in accordance with the project requirements. It will be appropriate the participation of the responsable of&#xD;
the superior project -even as a consultant- to the project in question in this condition. Furthermore, depending on the&#xD;
privacy status of the project, it is created a working directory at one of the code repositories “internal” or “uludag”&#xD;
under the subdirectory related to the topic. T he information and documents related to all the studies should be stored&#xD;
under this directory. All progress should be carried out over the Project T racking System and all the information and&#xD;
documents should be stores under the project’s working directory. Even if it has become absolute that a document put&lt;br />&#xD;
in the directory is not necessary anymore, it should not be removed for the purpose of recording; it should be presented to&#xD;
the required units within the “Project Final Report” when the project at available version or the project is at the end. In&#xD;
addition, an e-mail list could be opened for the purpose of the project issues’ discussion, in the circumstance of the need&#xD;
for the project.&lt;br />&#xD;
&lt;br />&#xD;
The working repository should be opened under “internal” or “projects” repositories together with the specified code name&#xD;
depending on the privacy status of the project.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
