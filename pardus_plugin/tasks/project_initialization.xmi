  <mainDescription>Project initialization starts with the statement of requirement description includes the main function of the software with
one or two sentences made by the person or people who requested the software. This explanation could be illustrated as
below:&lt;br />
&lt;br />
“It is necessary a graphical user interface for the user management in the system.”&lt;br />
&lt;br />
A Project leader is determined after the person who requested the software convey this information to the Operational
Coordinator.&lt;br />
&lt;br />
After the Project Leader is determined, a representational code name is determined for the project and with this name a
project is opened under Pardus Project T racking System (tracker.pardus.org.tr). It could be expressed as a sub-project of
another project in accordance with the project requirements. It will be appropriate the participation of the responsable of
the superior project -even as a consultant- to the project in question in this condition. Furthermore, depending on the
privacy status of the project, it is created a working directory at one of the code repositories “internal” or “uludag”
under the subdirectory related to the topic. T he information and documents related to all the studies should be stored
under this directory. All progress should be carried out over the Project T racking System and all the information and
documents should be stores under the project’s working directory. Even if it has become absolute that a document put&lt;br />
in the directory is not necessary anymore, it should not be removed for the purpose of recording; it should be presented to
the required units within the “Project Final Report” when the project at available version or the project is at the end. In
addition, an e-mail list could be opened for the purpose of the project issues’ discussion, in the circumstance of the need
for the project.&lt;br />
&lt;br />
The working repository should be opened under “internal” or “projects” repositories together with the specified code name
depending on the privacy status of the project.&lt;br /></mainDescription>
