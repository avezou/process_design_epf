    The software industry and literature use the term <strong>componen</strong>t to refer to many different things. It is
    often used in the broad sense to mean a constituent part. It is also frequently used in a narrow sense to denote
    specific characteristics that enable replacement and assembly in larger systems.
</p>
<p align="left">
    The Unified Modeling Language [<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.nav_view.base/guidances/supportingmaterials/references_C6FF2A8D.html" guid="__nHToFndEd2EdJKkAyeBng">UML05</a>] defines <em>component</em> as follows:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            A modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its
            environment. A component defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces. As such, a
            component serves as a type, whose conformance is defined by these provided and required interfaces
            (encompassing both their static as well as dynamic semantics).
        </p>
        <p>
            A <em>component</em> is defined as a subtype of structured class. Therefore, a component has attributes and
            operations, is able to participate in associations and generalizations, and has internal structure and ports.
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">
    Here, we use&nbsp;the term <em>component&nbsp;</em>in a&nbsp;broader way than the UML definition. Rather than defining
    components as having characteristics, such as modularity, deployability, and replaceability, we instead recommend these
    as desirable characteristics of components. We use <em>component</em> to mean <strong>an encapsulated part of a
    system</strong> that is nontrivial, nearly independent, and replaceable part of a system that fulfills a clear function
    in the context of well-defined architecture. This includes two types of components:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                <strong>Design component.</strong> A significant encapsulated part of the design that includes design
                subsystems and, sometimes, significant design classes and design packages.
            </p>
        </div>
    </li>
    <li>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                <strong>Implementation component.</strong> A significant encapsulated part of the implementation, generally
                code that implements a design component.
            </p>
        </div>
    </li>
</ul>
<p align="left">
    Ideally, the design reflects the implementation; therefore, you can simply refer to <em>components</em>, with each
    component having a design and an implementation.
</p>
<p align="left">
    Components interact through interfaces&nbsp;and&nbsp;may be composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.
</p>
<h3 align="left">
    Component replaceability
</h3>
<p align="left">
    In UML terminology, components should be replaceable. However, this may mean only that the component exposes a set of
    interfaces that hide an underlying implementation.
</p>
<p align="left">
    There are other, stronger, kinds of replaceability: .
</p>
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Source file replaceability:</strong> If two classes are implemented in a single source code file,
                then those classes cannot usually be separately versioned and controlled. However, if a set of files fully
                implements a single component (and no other component), then the component source files are replaceable.
                This characteristic makes it easier to use version control, to use the file as a baseline, and to reuse the
                source file.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Deployment replaceability:</strong> If two classes are deployed in a single executable file, then
                each class is not independently replaceable in a deployed system. It is desirable for larger-granularity
                components to be replaceable during deployment, which allows new versions of the component to be deployed
                without having to rebuild the other components. This usually means that there is one file or one set of
                files that deploy the component, and no other component.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Run-time replaceability:</strong> If a component can be redeployed into a running system, then it
                is referred to as <em>run-time replaceable</em>. This enables you to upgrade software without loss of
                availability.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Location transparency:</strong> Components with network-addressable interfaces are referred to as
                having <em>location transparency</em>. This allows components to be relocated to other servers or to be
                replicated on multiple servers to support fault tolerance, load balancing, and so on. These kinds of
                components are often referred to as <em>distributed</em> or <em>distributable</em> components.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<h3 align="left">
    Component instantiation
</h3>
<p align="left">
    A component may or may not be directly instantiated at run time.
</p>
<p align="left">
    An indirectly instantiated component is implemented, or realized, by a set of classes, subcomponents, or parts. The
    component itself does not appear in the implementation; it merely serves as a design that an implementation must
    follow. The set of realizing classes, subcomponents, or parts must cover the entire set of operations specified in the
    provided interface of the component. The manner of implementing the component is the responsibility of the implementer.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A directly instantiated component specifies its own encapsulated implementation. It is instantiated as an addressable
    object, which means that a design component has a corresponding construct in the implementation language; therefore, it
    can be referenced explicitly.
</p><p/><h3 align="left">
    Modeling Components
</h3>
<p align="left">
    The UML component is a modeling construct that provides the following capabilities:
</p>
<div align="left">
    <ul>
        <li>
            Group classes to define a larger granularity part of a system
        </li>
        <li>
            Separate the visible interfaces from internal implementation
        </li>
        <li>
            Execute instances run-time
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>
<p align="left">
    A component includes <strong>provided</strong> and <strong>required</strong> interfaces that form the basis for wiring
    components together. A <strong>provided interface</strong> is one that is either implemented directly by the component
    or one of its realizing classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a provided port of the component. A
    <strong>required interface</strong> is designated by a usage dependency of the component or one of its realizing
    classes or subcomponents, or it is the type of a required port.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A component has an external view (or <em>black box</em> view) through its publicly visible properties and operations
    .Optionally, a behavior such as a protocol state machine may be attached to an interface, a port, and the component
    itself to define the external view more precisely by making dynamic constraints in the sequence of operation calls
    explicit. The wiring between components in a system or other context can be structurally defined by using dependencies
    between component interfaces (typically on component diagrams).
</p>
<p align="left">
    Optionally, you can make a more detailed specification of the structural collaboration by using parts and connectors in
    composite structures to specify the role or instance-level collaboration between components. That is the component's
    internal view (or <em>white-box</em> view) through its private properties and realizing classes or subcomponents. This
    view shows how the external behavior is realized internally. The mapping between external and internal views is by
    dependencies on components diagrams or delegation connectors to internal parts on composite structure diagrams.
</p>
<p align="left">
    A number of UML standard stereotypes exist that apply to components, including &lt;&lt;subsystem&gt;&gt; to model
    large-scale components, and &lt;&lt;specification&gt;&gt; and &lt;&lt;realization&gt;&gt; to model components with
    distinct specification and realization definitions, where one specification may have multiple realizations.&nbsp;
</p>
<p align="left">
    The recommendation is to&nbsp;use components as the representation for design subsystems.
</p>
<h3 align="left">
    UML Definitions -- A History
</h3>
<p align="left">
    The definition of <em>component</em> with the UML has changed over time with the release of different versions. The
    version of UML you use may be constrained by the capabilities of the modeling tools you use. That is why the
    definitions from 1.3 to 2.0 are provided here.
</p>
<p align="left">
    UML 2.0 defined <em>component</em> as the following:
</p>
<blockquote dir="ltr" style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
    <blockquote>
        <p align="left">
            ...a modular part of a system that encapsulates its contents and whose manifestation is replaceable within its
            environment.
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            A component defines its behavior in terms of provided and required interfaces. As such, a component serves as a
            type whose conformance is defined by these provided and required interfaces (encompassing both their static as
            well as dynamic semantics).
        </p>
    </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">
    UML 1.5 defined <em>component</em> as the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <blockquote>
        <div align="left">
            A modular, deployable, and replaceable part of a system that encapsulates implementation and exposes a set of
            interfaces. A component is typically specified by one or more classes or subcomponents that reside on it and
            may be implemented by one or more artifacts (e.g., binary, executable, or script files).
        </div>
        <div align="left">
            <p>
                In UML 1.3 and earlier versions of the UML, the component notation was used to represent files in the
                implementation. Files are no longer considered components by the latest UML definitions. However, many
                tools and UML profiles still use the component notation to represent files.
