    There are several use scenarios for <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/method_configuration_C2B8FA8A.html" guid="__V7pAMaEEduMlb2cQZNTYw">method configuration</a>s produced by using EPF Composer or Rational Method Composer
    (both referred to generically here as "Method Composer"). The simplest&nbsp;is to use the&nbsp;published content as-is
    (either using a prepublished Web site or by publishing one using the content that is included with Method
    Composer).&nbsp;However, you may be&nbsp;looking for&nbsp;how to add, remove, suppress, or modify <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/method_content_6972AE81.html" guid="_Ts2joB_MEdq6CKKKq4D7YA">method content</a>&nbsp;or <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/process_68E308B4.html" guid="_yQ5m2NnmEdmO6L4XMImrsA">process</a>&nbsp;elements, or both, to make an existing method configuration
    more&nbsp;suitable&nbsp;to your teams' needs, while keeping it consistent and understandable.
</p>This guidance page describes typical customization scenarios and&nbsp;then provides references to additional
information on how to customize methods. 
<h3>
    Customization scenarios
</h3>
<p>
    The following sections describe&nbsp;possible customization scenarios. For information on specific tool features,
    consult the Method Composer online Help. For&nbsp;additional information on customizing methods, see the Additional
    Resources section that follows here.
</p>
<h4>
    Use existing plug-ins and packages to build your own process
</h4>
<p>
    Some consider this the most straight-forward customization scenario. Based on the provided content, you can use Method
    Composer to pick and choose the packages with the content that you want to publish and make available to your team.
    Removing a method package removes all references to the content of that package from the published process. For
    example, you can simplify a process to have it contain a minimal subset of its content by removing packages that
    contain elements of work that you do not want to perform. You do this by creating a new method configuration (or
    copying an existing one) into your method library. You can select packages as appropriate without affecting the
    configuration provided.
</p>
<h4>
    Add&nbsp;method content&nbsp;that your team needs
</h4>
<p>
    Some teams may need to perform a different task that is not covered by the standard content. Maybe they need to perform
    an extra step in an existing task, or they may need to add a new guideline for a given technique that they are
    following. Eventually, they need a new template for a document (or they may need to add or remove sections in an
    existing template).
</p>
<p>
    In such situations, the recommended approach is to create a separate plug-in in your library.&nbsp;It is not a good
    practice&nbsp;to make changes in the provided plug-in (meaning any plug-in for which you do not have control), because
    new versions of these plug-ins, when deployed, can override the changes that you have made.
</p>
<p>
    Method Composer provides a series of mechanisms that allow you to indirectly modify the content in an existing plug-in
    by using <i>content variability</i>. In your plug-in, you can define an element that contributes, extends, or replaces
    an element in the existing plug-in. For example, in your plug-in, you can define a task that contributes a new step to
    an existing task. You can also define a new artifact that replaces an existing artifact, and this new artifact can have
    a different name, structure, and associated template, for example. Then all you need to do is make sure that the
    existing plug-in and your new plug-in are part of the configuration to be published. During publication, Method
    Composer will resolve the content variability that you defined by adding the new content into the existing content
    where appropriate, replacing existing content with the content you defined, and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>
    Define a different development lifecycle
</h4>
<p>
    Both method content and process are created independently from&nbsp;each other. For example, you create tasks in the
    method content (and define their&nbsp;inputs, outputs, and responsible roles), but you do not necessarily define the
    lifecycle of your process, meaning the sequence in which the various tasks will be performed. On the process side, you
    then define the lifecycle (such as phases, iterations, activities, and tasks), as well as the precedence among these
    elements.
</p>
<p>
    Some teams may find the method content appropriate without any further customization, but they may want to work by
    following a different software development lifecycle. For example, some teams may like the four development phases and
    iterations from the unified process, but some may want to develop iteratively, without being tied to a specific phase
    structure. Again, you can add, remove and replace elements in the work breakdown structure of an existing process by
    applying process variability.
</p>
<p>
    As an alternative to tailoring an existing process, you can write a completely new process that reuses activities from
    one or more existing processes. In cases where you cannot find any reusable material at all, you can also create a
    completely new process from scratch. In most cases, however, you will start developing your own process by assembling
    reusable building blocks from method content, as well as predefined process patterns&nbsp;called <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/capability_pattern_F5DDC5F.html" guid="_2RUJACO4EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">capability patterns</a>. The resulting assembled process is called a&nbsp;<a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/delivery_process_BCDF50B7.html" guid="_ZufeMCO3EdqaNq6Ptg8uyA">delivery process</a>. This newly created delivery process&nbsp;is part of a
    configuration that you publish and make available to members of your team.
</p>
<h4>
    Publish the process Web site
</h4>
<p>
    Every customization scenario is finalized by publishing content as HTML (on a Web site). Method Composer enables you to
    publish&nbsp;content based on a given configuration, which will publish all of the content available from
    the&nbsp;method and process packages selected in that configuration. Another option for publishing is to select only
    the capability patterns or delivery process of interest. This will make available only the content related to the
    process packages that you select.
</p>
<p>
    For the published Web site look and feel, you can customize the views and nodes in the directory (tree) browser by
    defining <a class="elementLinkWithUserText" href="./../../../core.default.uma_concept.base/guidances/termdefinitions/custom_category_554AC4D6.html" guid="_eqw94MaFEduMlb2cQZNTYw">custom categories</a> that will be part of your configuration.
