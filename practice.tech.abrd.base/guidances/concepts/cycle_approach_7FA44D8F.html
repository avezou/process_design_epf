    The Agile Business Rule Development (ABRD) Methodology provides a framework that project teams may adapt to meet the
    needs of their specific business rules application project. The methodology supports the full rule lifecycle, from
    discovery to governance by using an 'agile', iterative approach. ABRD activities fall into five categories described
    below. Each of these activities is executed multiple times as the process is followed.<br />

        </p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in">
    Like all agile methodologies, in ABRD rules as other software element are developed incrementally, in multiple
    iterations of short time frames. However, in ABRD, the entire process lifecycle may not be followed for each iteration.
    Instead, a number of very short cycles between phases may occur, with the entire rule set gradually evolving. The
    entire process may be represented by the process flow diagram below:<br />
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0cm">
    <img alt="" src="./../../../practice.tech.abrd.base/guidances/concepts/resources/life_cycle_horizontal.jpg" />
</p>
<p>
    <br class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0cm" />
    In the process flow diagram above, each of the tasks loops back to previous tasks in the flow. These 'loops', or
    cycles, are repeated as required, with the loops gradually moving from left to right through the process until the rule
    sets are deployed. This method of rule development reflects the nature of BRMS: a mature and stable domain object model
    is a prerequisite for rule development, therefore we may multiply cycles through the early part of the process flow in
    order to develop such models early in the process. As each of these cycles is completed, the ruleset will gradually
    grow until it reaches a state where it reflects the requirements set forth by the business.

    Rule harvesting, consisting of the Discovery & Analysis tasks, involves gathering together all the sources of
    knowledge available to the team. These sources may include a business process description, subject matter experts,
    policy manuals or other sources of rules. The goal of this activity is to understand the Domain Object Model within the
    scope of the application and to identify enough rule patterns to begin implementation of rules in the next phase.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in">
    During this activity, the development teams divide the day into two parts, executing discovery workshops in the morning
    (in 2 or 3-hour sessions), then performing analysis and documentation for the remainder of the day. The team iterates
    on these two steps during 2 to 5 days maximum, depending on the number of rules and their complexity<br />

</p>
<p>
    <br />
    <strong>Cycle 2- Prototyping</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The prototyping activity extends the tasks performed to include rule authoring. When a workable number of rules (this
    number will vary by project) have been harvested the development team should start to define the structure of the rule
    project: the rule set parameters (input-output business objects), and the basic sequencing of the rules (the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../practice.tech.abrd.base/guidances/termdefinitions/ruleflow_27B05442.html" guid="__2sZYBCWEdyJtJ3PbfdVDw">ruleflow</a>), and the major elements of the <a class="elementLink" href="./../../../practice.tech.abrd.base/guidances/termdefinitions/bom_6AC0E84F.html" guid="_1iTjABCXEdyJtJ3PbfdVDw">Business Object Model</a>. The team should then be able to already implement some rules.
</p>
<p>
    Tip: During the first pass through the prototyping activity, it is better to err on the side of too few rules
</p>
<p>
    A best practice is to execute the step "Rule Authoring" as soon as possible to uncover possible analysis and design
    issues. Indeed, most of the rules look good on paper but real issues arise most of the time during implementation and
    test. The next morning workshop session communicates the issues back to the business team. This leverages the feedback
    loop approach and provides an efficient mechanism to build a pragmatic, adequate and business-relevant executable rule
    set.<br />

</p><br class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in" />
<br />
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in">
    The goal of the build activity is to create rules that can be 'seen', 'used' and, most importantly, tested, by business
    users. Rules that can be executed by the rule engine are more valuable than ones defined on paper or in abstract forms.
    This fully endorses the agile statement: "Working software over comprehensive documentation."
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in">
    The second goal of this phase is to create a set of realistic test scenarios, using real data if possible, to test the
    rules created during the Authoring activity. This is a form of Test Driven Development (TDD). This activity extends the
    Build activity by adding a Rule Validation task.<br class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0cm" />

</ul>

    The Building activity should take between two and three weeks, and the output artifacts should be a ruleset that can be

        <em>During the first iteration of this activity, the total number of rules will be only around 40% to 60%
        completed. The idea is to get something to business users that is sufficient to get comment and feedback on, and
        that will form the basis of the next phase. By this point, the Business Object Model (BOM) should be at least 90%
        complete</em>.<br />

<br />
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in">
    Depending on the size of the ruleset, this activity may deliver less than 40% of the rules. In that case, this activity
    may have to be repeated. In this situation, it is recommended that the activity be time-boxed to three weeks so that a
    concrete build may be delivered to the QA or validation team for review. Once a build is delivered, another iteration
    of this cycle may be started.<br />

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 3pt 0in">
    At the end of this cycle it is possible to release the rule set integrated as a&nbsp;decision service into the core

    goal of this cycle is to deploy the rule set under construction to the execution server in order to test it with an
    end-to-end scenario. The integration of the decision service and the&nbsp;domain object model is an important task.
    Integration involves the marshaling of data to/from external data sources, such as Database, MOM, files or sockets
    into a form that can be understood by the execution engine. This is a 'mapping' of the data received by the decision
    service to the Business Object Model created in previous activities.<br />
    There are a number of tools and techniques that can be used to marshal data, and the best choice will vary by project.
    When this activity is complete, data (preferably 'real' data) will be sent to the rule engine to fire rules, make
    decision and the results delivered over the same channels as the production system. These test scenarios were developed
    in previous phases, but now they're being run with all of the 'plumbing' in place. In the future they will serve as
    non-regression test suite<br />

    The Enhancing cycle is a transition phase in which last minute changes can be made involving some short, face to face
    discovery meetings with SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) to wrap up any outstanding issues or questions before entering
    the Governance activity. The Governance activity is an open-ended, long running process to enhance and maintain the
    rules created in previous activities. A governance process will vary by organization and is a fundamentally different
    process, usually performed by a different team than the rule development team. This team is more business oriented and,
    as owners of the rules and business policies, they can develop at their own pace, using the infrastructure put in place
    by the development team.<br />
