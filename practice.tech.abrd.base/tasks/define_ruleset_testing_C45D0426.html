    The recommended approach is to consider a rule-set as a unit piece of functionality that gets exposed to the rest of
    the application as a decision service (SOA pattern). Therefore it should be tested using the same strategy as for any
    other function in the system. One criterion of rule testing lies in the level of user friendliness that should be built
    into the test harness. Indeed, empowering business analysts with the ability to change the rules also means they should
    be tested with their changes. Typically developers code fixtures and do automated testing using JUnit. Business
    analysts should not write code, but should be able to put together fixtures to be tested against the rules.
</p>
<p>
    How much effort should be spent on the rule test harness really depends on the application, and also importantly on the
    IT-level of business analyst. Sometimes capturing test data in XML and having business analysts edit them is enough and
    very cost effective. Sometimes business analysts will feel more comfortable with Excel spreadsheets, or with a full GUI
    which would need a larger development effort to be facilitated.<br />
    It is usually a good idea whenever possible to keep individual test case data in files that can be put under source
    code management. This way the code base, the rules and the test cases can be kept in sync. This becomes important when
    multiple versions of a business rule are being worked on at different stages such as active development stage, test
    stage or production stage.<br />
    BRMS testing fits perfectly into this strategy due to its ability to produce the same sort of test fixtures as the
    other environments. Utilizing a tool such as JUnit as the test controller, test fixtures are stored in a test fixture
    repository for which the JUnit can access.
</p>
<h5>
    Testing Levels<br />
</h5>
<p>
    The following levels of testing are usually applied during the application construction:<br />
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Unit Test: applied to test classes and other application elements as developers build them. In the context of a
        BRMS, the goal of unit testing is to make sure that a rule is actually fired when expected, against the expect
        object instances and performs the expected working memory updates.
    </li>
    <li>
        Component Test: applied to test a group of elements (e.g. classes) which together represent a significant
        application component. In the context of a BRMS, a component is typically a rule service.
    </li>
    <li>
        System Test: applied to test the system performs the right business functions correctly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Acceptance Test: applied to ensure users are satisfied with the system. The last stages of acceptance testing are
        the alpha testing (testing performed internally by the company) and beta testing (testing performed by a limited
        audience outside of the company).
    </li>
    <li>
        The scope of this section is limited to unit-test (usually performed by rule developers) and component test
        (performed by both rule developers and rule authors), where components are understood as the rule services
        implemented by a rule engine.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once the rule service components are tested, the next levels can follow the general application testing process
    followed by the client's QA department, who are considering the rule services as black boxes.<br />
</p>
<h5>
    Testing Activities
</h5>
<p>
    This section relates to why testing is performed, that is what we are trying to get out of it. The goal of testing the
    decision service components is first and foremost to ensure the correctness of the decision rendered by the service
    with respect to the requirements.<br />
    Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are used to measure how close the actual test results are from the expectations. The
    focus of KPIs vary depending on the type of testing performed: for performance testing, the KPIs will obviously be
    interested in the time taken to execute the rules or tasks in the rule-set, for coverage, the focus will be on the set
    of rule fired and the set of tasks executed, and for more business-oriented testing of correctness, the focus will be
    on the accuracy of the response.<br />
</p>
<h5>
    Correctness<br />
</h5>
<p>
    For a decision-rich type of application, this is where most of the testing time and effort will be spent, using all
    types of resources from developers, to business analysts, to business rule writers and subject matter experts.<br />
    The goal here is to ensure that for a given request configuration, the system renders a response that conforms to the
    company business goals and policies, contractual obligations and possibly to compliance rules imposed by external
    agencies (laws and regulations). The impact of an incorrect decision can be profound, from lawsuits for non-compliance
    to risky financial commitments.<br />
    Testing the correctness of a business rules application necessarily involves the participation of SMEs, who will write
    test cases and manually produce the expected response. This is a very time and resource consuming activity which should
    be carefully taken into account when designing the test plan for an application.<br />
    Alternatively, some test cases can be extracted from a legacy system database. The benefit here is obvious: the
    database provides the number and the variety of test cases needed, and also guarantees the validity of the test
    cases.<br />
</p>
<h5>
    Regression<br />
</h5>
<p>
    The goal of regression testing is to uncover regression problems, that is, problems which were not present in the
    previous version of the application but appeared in the new version after a change was introduced. Regression testing
    for rules is used to make sure that after fixing, or updating a rule service, the functionalities which were working
    before are still working as expected. For example, after implementing a business change request which lowers the rates
    in the state of California, regression testing should be applied to ensure that rates remained unchanged in all other
    states.<br />
    Besides verifying that correctness is conserved from one version to another, regression testing is also used to verify
    that quality (for example, execution performance) is conserved.<br />
